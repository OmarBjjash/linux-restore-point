# **Linux Restore Tool üíæ**

A powerful command-line tool for Linux that brings Windows-like restore point functionality to your system. Easily create snapshots of your critical system configurations and user data, and revert to them when you need to.

## **‚ú® Features**

* **Flexible Restore Points:**  
  * **System-only:** Backup just your /etc directory (system configuration files).  
  * **Full System:** Include both /etc and your /home directory (user data) for a complete snapshot.  
* **USB Drive Inclusion:** Optionally include mounted USB drives in your backups. The tool will detect them and let you choose which ones to add.  
* **Seamless Restoration:** Restore your system from any previously created restore point.  
* **Easy Cleanup:** Delete old or unwanted restore points to save disk space.  
* **Real-time Progress:** Get visual feedback with a dynamic progress bar during backup and restore operations, powered by pv (Pipe Viewer).  
* **Comprehensive Logging:** Every create, restore, and delete action generates its own detailed log file, perfect for reviewing operations or troubleshooting.  
* **Colored Output:** Enjoy clear, at-a-glance status updates in your terminal:  
  * **Green:** Successful operations.  
  * **Yellow:** Warnings.  
  * **Red:** Errors.

## **üöÄ Installation**

### **System Dependencies**

Before installing the tool, make sure you have pv (Pipe Viewer) and tar installed on your Linux distribution.

* **For Debian/Ubuntu/Kali:**  
```bash
  sudo apt update  
  sudo apt install pv tar
```
* **For Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:**  
```bash
  sudo dnf install pv tar
```
* **For Arch Linux:**  
```bash
  sudo pacman \-S pv tar
```
### **Install the Tool**

Due to Python's "externally-managed-environment" policy (PEP 668\) on many modern Linux distributions, direct pip install . might be prevented to protect system integrity. Here are the recommended ways to install your tool:

#### **Using pipx (Recommended for Command-Line Applications)**

pipx installs Python applications into isolated environments and makes them available globally. It's the easiest way to manage CLI tools.

1. **Install pipx** (if you don't have it):  
```bash
   sudo apt install pipx # For Debian/Ubuntu/Kali  
   # OR if pipx is not in your distro's repos (less common for Kali):  
   python3 \-m pip install \--user pipx --break-system-packages  
   python3 \-m pipx ensurepath
```

2. **Navigate to your project directory:**  
```bash
   cd /path/to/your/linux-restore-point
```
3. **Install your tool with pipx:**  
```bash   
   pipx install .
```
   This will install linux-restore-point in its own isolated environment and make the linux-restore-point command globally available for your user.

## **üí° Usage**

All operations of linux-restore-point require sudo privileges as they interact with system-level directories and files.

### **Running Directly with sudo (Recommended after sudoers modification)**

To use linux-restore-point directly with sudo (e.g., sudo linux-restore-point list), you need to modify your system's sudoers configuration to allow sudo to find user-installed binaries. **Always use visudo to edit /etc/sudoers to prevent syntax errors.**

1. **Open sudoers with visudo:**  
```bash
   sudo visudo
```
2. Add your pipx bin directory to secure\_path:  
   Find the line that starts with Defaults secure\_path= and append your user's pipx binary directory (/home/YOUR\_USERNAME/.local/bin) to it. Replace YOUR\_USERNAME with your actual username (e.g., cyberspace).  
   * *Example secure\_path line before:*  

  > `Defaults    secure\_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"`
>
   *Example secure\_path line after modification:*  

   `Defaults    secure\_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin:/home/YOUR\_USERNAME/.local/bin"`

3. **Save and Exit visudo:**  
   * If using vi (default for visudo): Press Esc, then type :wq and press Enter.  
   * If using nano (if configured): Press Ctrl+X, then Y to confirm save, then Enter.  
4. **Open a new terminal session** for the changes to take effect.

Now you can use the commands directly:

* **Create a restore point:**  
```bash
  sudo linux-restore-point create \-n \<name\_of\_backup\> \-t \[system|full\] \[--include-usb\]
```
 > * \-n \<name\_of\_backup\>: A custom, descriptive name for your restore point (e.g., pre\_kernel\_update). A timestamp will be automatically appended.  
 > * \-t system: (Default) Backs up only /etc (your system's configuration files).  
 > * \-t full: Backs up both /etc and /home (your system configuration and all user data).  
 > * \--include-usb: (Optional flag) If present, the tool will detect and prompt you to select any currently mounted USB drives to include in the backup.

**Example:**sudo linux-restore-point create \-n pre\_big\_software\_install \-t full \--include-usb

* **List available restore points:**  
  sudo linux-restore-point list

  This will display a colored list of all restore points currently stored.  
* **Restore from a restore point:**  
  sudo linux-restore-point restore \-n \<full\_restore\_point\_name\>

  * \<full\_restore\_point\_name\>: The **exact** name of the restore point as shown by linux-restore-point list (e.g., pre\_big\_software\_install\_20250804\_194115).  
  * **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** Restoring will **overwrite** existing files in the backed-up locations. It is **highly recommended** to perform a restore from a **live Linux environment** (e.g., booting from a USB stick with your Linux distribution) to prevent issues with files being in use and to ensure system stability.

**Example:**sudo linux-restore-point restore \-n pre\_big\_software\_install\_20250804\_194115

* **Delete a restore point:**  
  sudo linux-restore-point delete \-n \<full\_restore\_point\_name\>

  * \<full\_restore\_point\_name\>: The exact name of the restore point to delete.  
  * **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This action is **irreversible**. Once a restore point is deleted, it cannot be recovered.

**Example:**sudo linux-restore-point delete \-n old\_test\_backup\_20250701\_100000

### **Alternative: Using sudo env PATH="$PATH" (No sudoers modification)**

If you prefer not to modify sudoers, you can always use the more verbose command:  
sudo env PATH="$PATH" linux-restore-point \<action\> \[options\]

## **üìÑ Logging**

Every create, restore, and delete operation generates its own unique log file. These are stored in /var/backups/linux\_restore\_points/ and named like linux\_restore\_point\_\<action\>\_\<timestamp\>.log. These logs provide detailed information about the process, including any warnings or errors encountered.
